# LaTeX_Macroses

This is a project with some non-standard latex tidbits I use.

For now this includes

- A command converting natural numbers in range [1,23] into characters of the phoenician alphabet (based on the ["phoenician"](https://ctan.asis.sh/fonts/archaic/phoenician/) package for $\LaTeX$). 
See [this file](Phoenician_lists.md).
